# Airlines-Data-Analysis-using-SQL-and-Python

## Description

Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. We have been providing high-quality air transportation services to our clients for several years, and our primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for our passengers.

## Challenges

However, we are currently facing challenges due to several factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs. As a result, the company's profitability is under pressure, and we are seeking ways to address this issue.

## Solution

To tackle this challenge, we are looking to conduct an analysis of our database to find ways to increase our occupancy rate, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, analyzing revenue data such as total revenue per year, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft is critical for airlines seeking to maximize profitability. By assessing these indicators, airlines can find areas for improvement and modify their pricing and route plans. A greater occupancy rate is one important feature that can enhance profitability since it allows airlines to maximize revenue while minimizing costs associated with vacant seats. However, boosting occupancy rates should not come at the price of consumer happiness or safety. Airlines must strike a balance between the necessity for profit and the significance of delivering high-quality service and upholding safety regulations. By adopting a data-driven strategy to revenue analysis and optimization, airlines may achieve long-term success in a highly competitive business.
